    Frustrated with how 'dirty' CMIP6 data still is? Do you just want to run a
    simple (or complicated) analysis on various models and end up having to
    write logic for each seperate case? Then this package is for you.

    Developed during the cmip6-hackathon this package provides utility
    functions that play nicely with intake-esm.
